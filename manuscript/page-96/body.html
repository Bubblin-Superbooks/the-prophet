<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not down into emptiness; And if this day is not a fulfilment of your needs and my love, then let it be a promise till another day.</p><p>Manâ€™s needs change, but not his love, nor his desire that his love should satisfy his needs.</p><p>Know therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return.</p><p>The mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in the fields, shall rise and gather into a cloud and then fall down in rain.</p><p>And not unlike the mist have I been.</p><p>In the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets, and my spirit has entered your houses,</p><p>And your heart-beats were in my heart, and your breath was upon my face, and I knew you all.</p><p>Ay, I knew your joy and your pain, and in your sleep your dreams were my dreams.</p></div> </div>
