And with a great voice he said:</p><p>When love beckons to you, follow him,</p><p>Though his ways are hard and steep.</p><p>And when his wings enfold you yield to him,</p><p>Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.</p><p>And when he speaks to you believe in him,</p><p>Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.</p><p>For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.</p><p>Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,</p><p>So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
