Think not I say these things in order that you may say the one to the other, “He praised us well. He saw but the good in us.”</p><p>I only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought.</p><p>And what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge?</p><p>Your thoughts and my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,</p></div> </div>
