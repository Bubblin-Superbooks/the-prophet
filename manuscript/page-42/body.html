<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Your house is your larger body.</p><p>It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless. Does not your house dream? and dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop?</p><p>Would that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow.</p><p>Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments.</p><p>But these things are not yet to be.</p><p>In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear shall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths from your fields.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
