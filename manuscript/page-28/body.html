<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And what is fear of need but need itself?</p><p>Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?</p><p>There are those who give little of the much which they haveâ€”and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.</p><p>And there are those who have little and give it all.</p><p>These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.</p><p>There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.</p><p>And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.</p><p>And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;</p><p>They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.</p></div> </div>
