But you who are born of the mountains and the forests and the seas can find their prayer in your heart,</p><p>And if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them saying in silence,</p><p>“Our God, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that willeth.</p><p>It is thy desire in us that desireth.</p><p>It is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into days which are thine also.</p><p>We cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us:</p><p>Thou art our need; and in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all.”</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
